# This repository contains a collection of set up guides for various tools and libraries in new machine.

# Set up with MacOS

## 1. Install brew

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## 2. SSH keys

Copy the `~/.ssh` folder from your old machine to the new machine. Use this command to grant access to the folder:

```bash
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
```

```text
The command `chmod 700 ~/.ssh` is used to change the permissions of the `~/.ssh` directory.

Breakdown:
- `chmod`: This command is used to change the file or directory permissions in Unix-like operating systems.
- `700`: This is the permission setting in octal format:
  - The first digit (7) applies to the owner of the file/directory.
  - The second digit (0) applies to the group.
  - The third digit (0) applies to others.
- `7` means full permissions (read, write, and execute).
- `0` means no permissions.
So, `700` means:
  - The owner has full permissions.
  - The group and others have no permissions.

Purpose: The purpose of the `~/.ssh` directory is to store SSH keys and configuration files that allow secure communication with remote servers.

## 3. Install tool

### Git

Read more about git [here](https://github.com/vosonha/RoR-Training/blob/main/docs/git.md)

git

```bash
brew install git
```

git-cola

```bash
brew install git-cola
```

gitk

```bash
brew install git-gui
```

### Ruby

```bash
brew install rbenv
```

**Some rbenv commands:**

Set up your shell to load rbenv automatically:

```bash
rbenv init
```

Installing Ruby versions

```bash
# list latest stable versions:
rbenv install -l

# list all local versions:
rbenv install -L

# install a Ruby version:
rbenv install 3.1.2
```

Set a Ruby version to finish installation and start using Ruby:

```bash
rbenv global 3.1.2   # set the default Ruby version for this machine
# or:
rbenv local 3.1.2    # set the Ruby version for this directory
```

**rbenv rehash**
Installs shims for all Ruby executables known to rbenv (~/.rbenv/versions/_/bin/_). Typically you do not need to run this command, as it will run automatically after installing gems.

```bash
rbenv rehash
```

**Note:** If you set `eval "$(rbenv init - zsh)"` in your `.zshrc`, you don't need to run `rbenv rehash` manually.
